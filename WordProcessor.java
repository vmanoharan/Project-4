		 * class Files has a method lines() which accepts an interface Path object and 
		 * produces a Stream<String> object via which one can read all the lines from a file as a Stream.
		 * 
		 * class Paths has a method get() which accepts one or more strings (filepath),  
		 * joins them if required and produces a interface Path object
		 * 
		 * Combining these two methods:
		 *     Files.lines(Paths.get(<string filepath>))
		 *     produces
		 *         a Stream of lines read from the filepath
		 * 
		 * Once this Stream of lines is available, you can use the powerful operations available for Stream objects to combine 
		 * multiple pre-processing operations of each line in a single statement.
		 * 
		 * Few of these features:
		 * 		1. map( )      [changes a line to the result of the applied function. Mathematically, line = operation(line)]
		 * 			-  trim all the lines
		 * 			-  convert all the lines to UpperCase
		 * 			-  example takes each of the lines one by one and apply the function toString on them as line.toString() 
		 * 			   and returns the Stream:
		 * 			        streamOfLines = streamOfLines.map(String::toString) 
		 * 
		 * 		2. filter( )   [keeps only lines which satisfy the provided condition]  
		 *      	-  can be used to only keep non-empty lines and drop empty lines
		 *      	-  example below removes all the lines from the Stream which do not equal the string "apple" 
		 *                 and returns the Stream:
		 *      			streamOfLines = streamOfLines.filter(x -> x != "apple");
		 *      			 
		 * 		3. collect( )  [collects all the lines into a java.util.List object]
		 * 			-  can be used in the function which will invoke this method to convert Stream<String> of lines to List<String> of lines
		 * 			-  example below collects all the elements of the Stream into a List and returns the List:
		 * 				List<String> listOfLines = streamOfLines.collect(Collectors::toList); 
		 * 
		 * Note: since map and filter return the updated Stream objects, they can chained together as:
		 * 		streamOfLines.map(...).filter(a -> ...).map(...) and so on
